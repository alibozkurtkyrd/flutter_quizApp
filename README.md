## flutter_quizApp

This project consists of 2 parts;

# 1- mobile application part (flutter)
  
Questions taken from the web part with the help of json are displayed in the mobile application.
In order to ensure the safety of the exam, the user cannot start the quiz without having the photograph taken. 
Each stage has 7 questions and 60 seconds of time, and each question is 10 points.


# 2- Web part (php)

It is the part where the question is created for the mobile application. It also performs operations such as updating and deleting questions in 
the question pool. Finally, the created questions are saved in Mysql and then converted to json.

A connection was established between the web and mobile application via LAMP.<hr>
